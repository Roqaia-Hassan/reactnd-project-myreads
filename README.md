# MyReads Project

This is the second project of the udacity Nanodegree frontend web development advanced.
The project is used to categorize the books in three bookshelves and to search for books using specific search terms (title and author). The books are stored in one of the three bookshelves:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
 I used the Udacity starter kit for building the project. 
 Also, I used the React Context to pass data through the components tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
 Other thing helped me to have well functionality for the project is using some of the array properties like {map, filter & find}.

## Project's Purpose
The aim from this project is to use react perfectly and to exercize on react concepts and methods like components and how to deal with its props and states, routers, links & life cycle events.

## Backend Server

Other languages used in the project are: {(HTML5, Javascript)=> JSX} & CSS3
